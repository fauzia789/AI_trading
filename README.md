# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, a deep learning model that analyzes past stock trends to forecast future prices. The project is built using **Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit**, with stock data sourced from the **Alpha Vantage API**.

## 📊 Features
✅ Fetch historical stock data using **Alpha Vantage API**  
✅ Preprocess and normalize stock prices for LSTM modeling  
✅ Train an **LSTM neural network** to predict future prices  
✅ Evaluate the model with actual vs predicted stock prices  
✅ Deploy the model using **Streamlit** for easy visualization  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Data Processing & Modeling)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (LSTM Model)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Data Preprocessing)
- **Alpha Vantage API** (Stock Data)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Prediction-LSTM.git
cd Stock-Prediction-LSTM
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Get Your Alpha Vantage API Key
- Sign up at [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and get an API key.
- Add it to the `stock_data.py` file:
```python
api_key = 'your_api_key'
ts = TimeSeries(key=api_key, output_format='pandas')
```

### 4️⃣ Train the LSTM Model (Optional)
```bash
python model_training.py
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Streamlit Web App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📈 Model Performance
- The LSTM model was trained using **historical stock prices** (2010-2019) with a **70-30 train-test split**.
- Evaluation metrics: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Results: The model successfully **predicts future trends** but may have **some deviation due to market volatility**.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
🔹 Train on a larger dataset with multiple stock tickers.  
🔹 Improve accuracy with **hyperparameter tuning**.  
🔹 Add more indicators like **MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands**.  
🔹 Integrate **real-time stock prediction** using live API data.
